# ideaHub
A free platform where users can pitch ideas, recruit teammates, and begin their entrepreneurial journey. 

## Description
The concept for ideaHub originated in S.J.Quigley's Technical Communications class at the University of Pittsburgh. The web application is intended as a space for students at the University of Pittsburgh to share their project ideas in a school-wide network including other students, faculty, and staff, recruiting like-minded team members and reaching mentorship opportunities. 

## Features
Why stasis theory? Stasis theory is a pre-writing process that helps writers make deep analyses of the issues they are investigating by asking four key questions: conjecture, definition, quality, and policy. Conjecture refers to the facts of the problem at hand, definition, the meaning or nature of the issue, quality, the serious of the issue, and policy, the plan of action. We chose to utilize stasis theory as a way for students to develop and critically think about their project ideas while creating a pitch.
