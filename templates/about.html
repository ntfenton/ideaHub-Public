					<h3 class="featurette-heading">Conjecture</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word">From healthcare technology to solutions in diversity, students are coming up with great ideas to solve everyday problems. The unfortunate thing is not all of these ideas are recognized and fostered. Many universities currently lack the support infrastructure for connecting students to the teams, tools, and resources they need for their ideas to take root and flourish. We at ideaHub see this as an opportunity--ideaHub presents a way for students to reach out to like-minded peers across all disciplines to share ideas, projects, and opportunities, while connecting them to faculty mentorship and funding possibilities.</p>
				</TH>

				<TH class="my-col">
					<h3 class="featurette-heading">Definition</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word">Most univerisites offer a similars tools to connect fellow students on student led projects. However, these tools have two major flaws. First, they have low advertisement and usage, which makes finding teams to kick off projects very difficult. Secondly, they don't guide students through the critical early stages of idea development: namely, the pitch. Our hope is that ideaHub will be advertised by universities and will allow projects to be properly pitched to a much larger audience of interested students.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word">ideaHub provides students the support structure that they need to successfully develop their ideas:
						<ul style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word">
							<li style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word">Creating a team - recruit people who are interested in the same field as the project using tags</li>
							<li style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word">Finding faculty support - find faculty that do research in the project area</li>
							<li style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word">Building a follower network - create a mini customer base of individuals who are attracted by the idea and want to engage with the product/service</li>
						</ul>
					</p>	
					<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word">ideaHub also brings new focus on the project pitch.  To do this, ideaHub asks for several pieces of information to generate a throughly designed project pitch:</p>
						<ul style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word">
							<li style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word">Project title - a catchy product name, or simply a working title to let other students find the project</li>
							<li style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word">Address stasis theory - what is the purpose? what problems are being addressed?</li>
							<li style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word">Visualizations - upload images, wireframes, or storyboards to further outline the project idea </li>
						</ul>

					<h3 class="featurette-heading">Quality</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word">We need to solve this problem to prevent good ideas from falling apart before they even get started. ideaHub not only provides a way to pitch ideas, but creates a support network around an idea to prevent great ideas from fizzling out. ideaHub gives our stakeholders--any student who has an idea--a clear path forward for success. Additionally, universities pride themselves on research and projects. This web app will allow univerisities to better support student-led projects and yield a higher success rate.</p>

					<h3 class="featurette-heading">Policy</h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word">ideaHub is a free to use tool that enables univiersity students to pitch a project, find student collaborators, obtain faculty support, and create a follower base. ideaHubâ€™s focus on the pitch and walkthrough of stasis theory will hopefully lead to higher success rates for developing student driven ideas compared to currently existing tools. </p>
					<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word">Our intention for ideaHub was to create a website that allows students to pitch their ideas to other students. To approach this problem we focused on the actual project creation side of our website. This allowed us to focus on ensuring that students are able to present engaging and informative projects to other students. 
					Going forward we plan to focus on the applicant's perspective on the website by:
						<ul style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word">
							<li style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word">Allowing students to update their applications after submission.</li>
							<li style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word">Providing a list of all of the applications that a student has applied for in the past.</li>
							<li style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word">Allowing students to view the status of their application after submission. </li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word">We also plan on making it possible for students to recieve support from outside of the school. This could allow 
					them to recieve funding for their ideas, gain validation in their intended major field, and even recieve oppurtunities
					from companies that are interested in their ideas. </p>
